    "The production of maple syrup, known as “sugaring”, takes place just as winter is losing its grip. The maple producers, or “sugarmakers” look for weather that alternates between freezing and thawing; this is what makes the sap flow. In Vermont, sugaring weather usually starts around the beginning of March and normally lasts for about six weeks. Before the sugarmakers can produce syrup, they must tap their trees and this happens during January and February. Snow may lay deep in the woods at the start of sugaring, but the warm sun on the branches of the maple trees causes the long dormancy of winter to give way and the sugaring season to begin.\n",

    "There is some controversy over whether fertilizer application can boost sap production in maple trees. It is known that vigorous trees tend to produce more sap, and trees with more foliage tend to have sweeter sap. However, it is not clear whether fertilizer application can help, and if so, by how much.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Vermont Maple Sugar Producers sponsored a testing program to determine the benefit of fertilizer application. A random sample of 27 maple trees in Vermont was chosen and treated with one of three levels of fertilizer. In this experimental setup, nine trees were treated in the summer with each fertilizer level and the amount of sap produced (in ml) by each tree the following spring was measured.\n",
