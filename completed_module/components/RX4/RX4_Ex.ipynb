    "# RX4: DDT in the Tennessee River\n",
    "\n",
    "Chemical and manufacturing plants have historically discharged toxic waste materials into nearby rivers and streams. These toxicants have a detrimental effect on the plant and animal life inhabiting the river and the river's bank. One type of pollutant, commonly known as DDT, is especially harmful to fish and, indirectly, to people. A study was undertaken to examine the DDT content of fish inhabiting the Tennessee River and its tributaries. The Tennessee River flows in a west-east direction across the northern part of the state of Alabama, through Wheeler Reservoir, a national wildlife refuge. Ecologists fear that contaminated fish migrating from the mouth of the river to the reservoir could endanger other wildlife that prey on the fish.\n",

    "\n",
    "A manufacturing plant was once located along Indian Creek, which enters the Tennessee River 321 miles upstream from the mouth. Although the plant has been inactive for over 10 years, there is evidence that the plant discharged toxic materials into the creek, contaminating all the fish in the immediate area. Have the fish in the Tennessee River and its tributary creeks also been contaminated? And if so, how far upstream have the contaminated fish migrated? To answer these and other questions, members of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers collected fish specimens at different locations along the Tennessee River (TR) and three tributary creeks: Flint Creek (FC, which enters the river 309 miles upstream from the river’s mouth), Limestone Creek (LC, 310 miles upstream), and Spring Creek (SC, 282 miles upstream). Each fish was first weighed (in grams) and measured (length in centimeters), then the fillet of the fish was extracted and the DDT concentration (in parts per million) of the fillet was measured. Three species of fish were examined: channel catfish, largemouth bass, and smallmouth buffalo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fish.txt data file contains the location, length, weight, and DDT measurements for a total of 144 fish specimens. Obviously, not all the fish in the Tennessee River and its tributaries were captured, so the data represent a sample collected from the population of all fish. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers used the data in this file to compare the DDT contents of fish at different locations and among the different species, and to determine the relationship (if any) of length and weight to DDT content. We will investigate some of these issues in this exercise.\n",
