    "# RX1: Importing Data and Histograms \n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial variation in velocity and depth over a stream reach is one of the most important factors regulating stream ecosystem structure and function. The habitat of plants, invertebrates, and fish is strongly influenced by these variables and by the resulting flow characteristics. Human modification of streams, especially flow regulation and riverbed channelization, is therefore altering local habitat suitability.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/R4jTkKH.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore the **distributions of depth and velocity in streams**, as well as their **joint distribution**. Along the way, we will cover various R functions for working with both **empirical (i.e. data-based) and theoretical distributions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing Data Using Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "Lamouroux and Jowett (2005) reported in-stream data  from  92  stream  reaches  in  New  Zealand. Each  reach  was  surveyed  once  to  obtain  a  set  of **velocity-depth     pairs**     representing     *hydraulic conditions* at various points throughout the reach at  the  time  of  the  survey.Here  we  focus  on  the **275**  point  data  collected  at  the  river  Opihi.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://i.imgur.com/tjDug71.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways we can import data in to R. The provided solutions will use the SECOND way, and we recommend this way too. However, it is important to know both. That way, you can chose which one you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 1: Setting a working directory. This requires you to download the data on to your local machine and access it directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, you must download the data from Canvas. It is under:\n",
    "\n",
    "Files > RX > \"Opihi.txt\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Save this file to your hard drive, and **REMEMBER ITS LOCATION**. You will need to know which in which directory it resides (for example, \"Downloads\") in order to use it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that files must be TEXT files (.txt). In some future RX assignments, Canvas files are excel (.xls) files. When you download them, you will need to *SaveAs -> .txt file* in order to proceed with this method.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to **set our working directory**. This is done with thr R command: **setwd()**\n",
    "\n",
    "This command takes the string of the *directory path* as an argument. The directory path we want to use is the one in which \"Opihi.txt\" is stored. For example, if you are on a personal computer and stored the file in your *Downloads*, your command may look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "setwd(\"/Users/your_name/Downloads\")\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you do this, we can access the .txt file (and any other file in this direcotry) straight from the command line. **Make sure your path is in \"quotations\", and note the use of FORWARD SLASHES!**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you can create an R object to hold all of this data using the **read.table()** command, which works as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Robject_name = read.table(\"TextFileName.txt\", header=TRUE)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this case, our file is called \"Opihi.txt\". Name your R object apropriately. We suggest \"opihi\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the arguments here - We want **header=TRUE** to indicate that the data has column headers\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Option 2: Reading from Github Repository. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also access all of our text files through a git repository. We have one for this class through Dartmouth's DIFUSE project. You do not need to download anything from Canvas. This is the command we will use:\n",
    " \n",
    "Robject_name <- read.delim(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/difuse-dartmouth/engineering-statistics-in-R/main/completed_module/data/Opihi.txt\", header = TRUE, sep = \"\\t\", dec = \".\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- Robject_name is the name of your R object you wish to create\n",
    "- Opihi.txt is the text file we are trying to access. In future RX assignments, this will change depending on which file we want to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the use of '<-' for assigning instead of '=', and that the url to the GitHub is in quotations! \n",
    "\n",
    "All files in the Github are text files, so no conversion is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "**EXERCISE 1:** Using one of the options described above read the data from \"Opihi.txt\" into an R object called \"opihi\". \n"
