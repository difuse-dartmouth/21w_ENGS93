    "Questions 3 and 4 from R Exercise #3 are examples of situations in which exactly one parameter value is specified under the alternate hypothesis (e.g. H1: 𝜇= 40). This is referred to as a simple hypothesis. If a hypothesis specifies more than one value, then it is called a composite hypothesis (e.g. H1: 𝜇 > 15). To get a complete picture of the error rates when the hypotheses are composite, it is often useful to plot the two error rates as functions of the true population parameter (e.g. 𝜇 in our example). Instead of dealing with these two functions separately, we can combine them into a single function called the operating characteristic (OC) function of the test. In general, if 𝜃 denotes the population parameter, then the OC function is the probability of failing to reject H0 as a function of 𝜃:\n",
