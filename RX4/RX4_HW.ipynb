    "- **Normal QQ plot**: The points should generally fall along the 1:1 line.\n",

Specifically, it measures the effect of deleting a given observation on the other fitted values. Data points with large residuals (i.e., outliers) and/or high leverage will have a high Cook’s distance. In the plot, Cook’s distance is indicated by red contour lines. Points with a Cook's distance of 1 or more are considered to merit closer examination.\n",

    "Create a ``plot`` command on the`` ddt.lm`` object as above. Looking at the top two charts, what can you conclude about the residuals? Do you think any other transformations are necessary? Try models in which you keep the ln transform of ``DDT`` and transform the ``LENGTH`` variable by taking the square root, the square, and the cube. Do any of these lead to significantly better residual plots or $R^2$ values?"
